I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Embedded Systems Laboratory (ESL)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/esl/) of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). I earned my Ph.D. at EPFL under the supervision of [Prof. David Atienza](https://people.epfl.ch/david.atienza) and [Prof. Luis Costero](https://produccioncientifica.ucm.es/investigadores/263573/detalle). I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), supervised by [Prof. Hai Wang](https://wanghaiuestc.github.io/). My research focuses on **thermal modeling**, **thermal management**, **edge computing**, and **cloud computing**.

## Looking for Ph.D. Students

**Starting Spring 2026**, I will join the **University of Hong Kong (HKU)** as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor. I am seeking motivated Ph.D. students interested in **edge AI accelerator design** for **integrated communication–computing systems**, a research direction aimed at bridging the gap between cloud and edge computing. If you're interested in joining or would like more information, please contact me:

- **Email**: darong.huang@epfl.ch  
- **Subject**: `PhD Application_Your University_Your Name`  
- **Attachments**: CV, undergraduate/graduate transcripts, publication list, and (optional) a one-page research statement outlining your background and how it relates to my work.
